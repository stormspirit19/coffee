                        <p>
                            We’re built on a simple mission and a commitment to doing good along the <br>
                            way. We want to make it easy for you to discover and brew the world’s best <br>
                            coffee at home. It all starts at the source. To locate the specific lots we want <br> 
                            to purchase, we travel nearly 60 days a year trying to understand the <br>
                            challenges and opportunities in each of these places. We collaborate with <br>
                            exceptional coffee growers and empower a global community of farmers <br>
                            through with well above fair-trade benchmarks. We also offer training, support <br> 
                            farm community initiatives, and invest in coffee plant science. Curating only <br>
                            the finest blends, we roast each lot to highlight tasting profiles distinctive to <br>
                            their native growing region.

                            harvest and processing, we employ, on our end, a rigorous quality control <br>
                             program to avoid over-roasting or baking the coffee dry. Every bag of coffee is <br> 
                             tagged with a roast date and batch number. Our goal is to roast consistent, <br>
                             user-friendly coffee, so that brewing is easy and enjoyable.
